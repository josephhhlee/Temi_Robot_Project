# Temi_Robot_Project

### Introduction

This program enables the Temi Robot to offer concierge services, such as providing navigational guidance and handling express food orders during its patrols. It uses a TCP socket to remotely activate Temi's tasks and simultaneously publishes information gathered by Temi to the database.
